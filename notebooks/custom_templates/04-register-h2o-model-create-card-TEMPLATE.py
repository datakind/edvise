# WARNING: AutoML/mlflow expect particular packages with version constraints
# that directly conflicts with dependencies in our SST repo. As a temporary fix,
# we need to manually install a certain version of pandas and scikit-learn in order
# for our models to load and run properly.

# COMMAND ----------

# project configuration should be stored in a config file in TOML format

# from hard-coded notebook variables to shareable, persistent config fields

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Edit model card markdown file as you see fit before exporting as a PDF
# MAGIC - A markdown should now exist in your local directory. Feel free to edit directly in DB's text editor before running the cell below.
# MAGIC - You don't need to refresh the browser or restart your cluster etc, the model card function will re-read the markdown below before exporting as a PDF
# MAGIC - You can access the PDF via ML artifacts in your registered model, as you will not be able to view the PDF locally in DB workspace.
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# Reload & publish
card.reload_card()
